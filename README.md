Scripts Used for Resolving Tickets

MFA Update NUmber: The "MFA update number.ps1" script is designed to update a user's phone number in their authentication methods using the Microsoft Graph API. It performs tasks such as formatting phone numbers, retrieving user information, and updating or adding phone numbers based on the specified method type (mobile, alternate mobile, or office). The script ensures accurate phone number formatting and provides feedback on successful updates, while also handling errors and edge cases gracefully. This helps maintain up-to-date and correctly formatted phone numbers for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) purposes.
